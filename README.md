# EasyEFIMaker
Simple python application that helps users build EFIs. 

## Status
Unusable. Project in a VERY early state, basically just downloads and unzips files xD

## Contributing
If you have code to contribute, please feel free to open a pull request! 

If you have a custom EFI for a specific motherboard DM me on Discord `ephraimk` 
I can add it to the application!
