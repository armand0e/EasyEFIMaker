# EasyEFIMaker
Simple python application that helps users build EFIs. 

## Notice
I am working a full time job so I work on this over than weekends and in the evenings making development slow. Hope you all understand.

## Status
Unusable. Project in a VERY early state, basically just downloads and unzips files xD

If you want to test the functionality, after running the script delete the "propertree" folder from within the "tools" folder, and then download OpenCore, than download ProperTree, in that order.

## Contributing
If you have code to contribute, please feel free to open a pull request! 

If you have a custom EFI for a specific motherboard DM me on Discord `ephraimk` 
I can add it to the application!
